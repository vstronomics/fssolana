# [Tutorial] Fullstack Solana Development

### Hello, world
This repository is simply me documenting code examples and notes from the following tutorial: [The Complete Guide to Full Stack Solana Development with Read, Anchor, Rust, and Phantom](https://github.com/dabit3/complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development).

This is my first foray into learning about blockchains, Web3, and the Solana ecosystem; my goal with completing this tutorial is to take an, active project-based learning approach and get some hands-on experience I can refer back to when I continue learning through reading books or watching videos.
